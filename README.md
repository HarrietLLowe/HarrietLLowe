- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @HarrietLLowe. I am currently a Senior Lecturer in Applied Linguistics, branching into Data Science and Data Analytics. 
My interest in programming has developed from the use of PyschoPy and Python during my PhD research.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Science, Machine Learning (particularly in the field of NPL & linguistics) and using tools to analyse data in academic disciplines. 
- ðŸŒ± You will find Python projects on this GitHub but I am currently learning SQL & Tableau for data analytics.
