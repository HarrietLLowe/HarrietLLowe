- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @HarrietLLowe, currently attempting to develop and refine my skills in Python and R for both Data Science and statistical analysis. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Machine Learning (particularly in the field of NPL & linguistics) and using tools to analyse data in academic disciplines. 
- ðŸŒ± You will find Python projects on this GitHub along with test repos for my apprentices at Multiverse.
